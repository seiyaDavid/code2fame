These additions will provide a more comprehensive privacy assessment of the 
synthetic data, including advanced metrics that are commonly used in 
privacy-preserving data synthesis. The membership attack simulation tests how 
well an adversary could determine if a record was part of the original dataset, 
the differential privacy estimate provides an approximation of the privacy leakage, 
and the k-anonymity distance measures how well the synthetic data preserves anonymity.

Understanding K-Anonymity Distance of 0.56
A K-Anonymity Distance of 0.56 indicates a moderate to strong level of privacy protection in your synthetic data. Let me explain what this metric means:
What is K-Anonymity Distance?
K-Anonymity Distance measures how far synthetic data points are from their k-nearest neighbors in the original dataset, after standardization (scaling the data to have zero mean and unit variance).
In your implementation:
We use k=5 (or less if there's not enough data)
We measure the Euclidean distance in the standardized feature space
The value 0.56 represents the average minimum distance to the k-th neighbor
Interpreting the Value of 0.56
Scale: The distances are measured in standardized space, where a distance of 1.0 roughly corresponds to one standard deviation in the original data
Privacy Implication: A value of 0.56 means that, on average, synthetic records are more than half a standard deviation away from their 5th nearest neighbor in the original data
Comparison Point:
Values below 0.1 would indicate very low privacy protection
Values between 0.1-0.5 indicate moderate protection
Values above 0.5 (like yours) suggest strong privacy protection
What This Means for Your Data
With a K-Anonymity Distance of 0.56:
Good Privacy Protection: Your synthetic data points are sufficiently distant from clusters of original data points
Low Re-identification Risk: It would be difficult to link synthetic records back to specific original records
Good Generalization: The model has learned patterns rather than memorizing specific data points
This suggests your synthetic data generation process is working well from a privacy perspective - it's creating data that maintains statistical properties while keeping a safe distance from the original records.
